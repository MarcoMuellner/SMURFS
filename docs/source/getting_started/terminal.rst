Standalone settings
===================

You have now completed the Quickstart example. But what options are available to run SMURFS? Below you can find a
full list of settings available through the terminal. If you are interested in some examples, you can take a look at
those as well. Mandatory parameters are noted as such, the optional ones give you the default as well. **Call
*smurfs -h* to show a help message, explaining all parameters.**

Positional arguments are required for every run of SMURFS. Named parameters can be used as explained below

.. argparse::
   :ref: smurfs.__main__.get_parser
